## Rules, Practices and Principles

1. Always use `AD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename `.php` files if they are pages; always use `index.php` as the filename.
3. Add `.component` to the `.php` files if they are components code; example: `footer.component.php`.
4. Add `.util` to the `.php` files if they are utility codes; example: `account.util.php`.
5. Place Files in their respective folders.
6. Different file naming Cases  
   | Naming Case | Type of code         | Example                           |
   | ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
   | Pascal      | Utility              | Account.util.php                  |
   | Camel       | Components and Pages | index.php or footer.component.php |
7. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
8. Use proper label in your github commits: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor` and `docs`
9. File Structure to follow below.

```

|   |   └─ name.css
